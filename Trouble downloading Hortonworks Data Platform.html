<p>In the next lecture, we're going to install a complete "big data" framework - Hortonworks Data Platform - on your own desktop!</p><p>However, the download process on the Cloudera website seems to work unreliably at times. If you find you cannot download the HDP 2.6.5 sandbox image for Virtualbox as shown, try going directly to this page:</p><p><a href="https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/hortonworks-sandbox/hdp.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/hortonworks-sandbox/hdp.html</a></p><p>Choose "Virtualbox" for your installation type, provide the information they request, and then select HDP 2.6.5 from the "older versions."</p><p>If that also fails, you can try a direct link to their HDP&nbsp;2.6.5 download:</p><p><a href="https://archive.cloudera.com/hwx-sandbox/hdp/hdp-2.6.5/HDP_2.6.5_virtualbox_180626.ova" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://archive.cloudera.com/hwx-sandbox/hdp/hdp-2.6.5/HDP_2.6.5_virtualbox_180626.ova</a></p><p>Or, if you need 2.5 instead:</p><p><a href="https://archive.cloudera.com/hwx-sandbox/hdp/hdp-2.5.0/HDP_2.5_virtualbox.ova" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://archive.cloudera.com/hwx-sandbox/hdp/hdp-2.5.0/HDP_2.5_virtualbox.ova</a></p><p>Remember, you need at least 8GB of free RAM on your system to run HDP. If you don't have that much memory, don't worry - you can still learn by just watching the videos.</p><p>Onward!</p>
