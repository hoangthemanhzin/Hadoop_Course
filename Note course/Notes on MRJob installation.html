<p>In the next activity, we'll walk you through installing the "mrjob" package for MapReduce on the&nbsp;HDP&nbsp;Sandbox.</p><h4>Installing mrjob on HDP&nbsp;2.65</h4><p>The following video will walk you through these steps, but you may find it helpful to have the commands in writing so you can just copy and paste them as you go (be sure to "su root"&nbsp;first, as shown in the video.)</p><p><br></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">yum-config-manager --save --setopt=HDP-SOLR-2.6-100.skip_if_unavailable=true

If you do run into this, just update your sandbox to Python 2.7 by entering the following commands:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">yum install scl-utils
yum install centos-release-scl
yum install python27
scl enable python27 bash</pre><p>Now, you should be able to </p><p><code>pip install google-api-python-client==1.6.4</code></p><p>successfully.</p><p> </p><p>If you're still having trouble, please use the Q&amp;A&nbsp;feature for this lecture and we'll help you out.<br></p>
